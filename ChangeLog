	* include/egghead.h: Implemented state bitmask operations. Defined new
	eh_state_t enum to represents bit values. Added ei_state of type
	eh_state_t to manage interpreter state. Also defined EGGHEAD_FLAG_* macros
	for manipulating bitmask.

	* src/debugger.c: Changed runloop() to continue running while EGGHEAD_EXIT
	flag is not set. To work properly, egghead_dbg_cmd_quit() has been
	modified to simply set this flag and return.

	* src/main.c: Added 'exit' label near end of main() so that goto can be
	used to minimize the number of exit points and, as a side effect, reduce
	memory leaks when memory for 'options' struct is not deallocated.

	* include/egghead.h: Defined UNUSED() macro for declaring a given function
	parameter as unused to eliminate compiler warnings.

	* src/debugger.c: Added UNUSED(interp) to egghead_dbg_cmd_help() and
	UNUSED(interp) and UNUSED(cmd) to egghead_dbg_cmd_quit().

	* src/debugger.c: Added real implementation of `help` command in
	egghead_dbg_cmd_help().

2012-06-10 Kevin Polulak <kpolulak@gmail.com>
	* Makefile: Added -Wnonnull switch to $CC_WARN variable since a few new
	functions in src/debugger.c use __attribute__((nonnull)).

	* include/debugger.h: Added eh_interp_t struct for describing info about
	the interpreter. Modified *eh_cmd_func_t() to take a eh_interp_t* pointer
	as the first parameter. Also reordered where several struct definitions
	appear so that everything is declared first before it is referenced.

	* src/debugger.c: Created several new functions including:
		+ Static
			* runloop(): Executes main "get-command-run-command" runloop.
			* get_cmd(): Prompts user to enter command.
			* run_cmd(): Executes *eh_cmd_func_t() associated with given command.
			* parse_cmd(): Parses input for valid command and arguments.
			* skip_whitespace(): Called by parse_cmd() to get next argument.
		+ Non-static
			* egghead_dbg_init(): Initializes interpreter and starts runloop.

	* src/main.c: Added support for new --debugger that invokes the debugger
	by calling egghead_dbg_init().

2012-06-09 Kevin Polulak <kpolulak@gmail.com>
	* include/debugger.h: New file. Contains structures and definitions needed
	by the upcoming debugger.

	* src/debugger.c: New file. Debugger implementation. Currently contains
	only a small dispatch table and empty "skeleton" functions for `help` and
	`quit` commands.

2012-06-06 Kevin Polulak <kpolulak@gmail.com>
	* Makefile: Added -std=c99 to CFLAGS.

	* include/egghead.h: Created new eh_opts_t structure for managing
	command-line switches that affect interpretation. Also changed
	egghead_eval_char() and egghead_eval_file() to accept a structure of this
	type as a parameter.

	* src/egghead.c: In egghead_eval_char(), included 'default' case in main
	'switch' statement to cause an error when new --strict switch is given.

	* src/main.c: Created new default_options() static function for populating
	main eh_opts_t structure with the default configuration. Also added code
	to process new --strict switch. Modified usage() to display information
	about --strict.

	* tests/bad_chars.t: Added another test case to verify that the new
	--strict switch works as intended.

	* tests/help.t: Updated $expected string to reflect new changes that
	display information about the --strict switch.

2012-06-05 Kevin Polulak <kpolulak@gmail.com>
	* Version 1.0
		+ Features all eight brainfuck commands.
		+ Small but effective test suite.
		+ No documentation yet.
		+ Uses hard-coded Makefile.  Future plans for Autoconf as well.
