	* Makefile: Added -std=c99 to CFLAGS.

	* include/egghead.h: Created new eh_opts_t structure for managing
	command-line switches that affect interpretation. Also changed
	egghead_eval_char() and egghead_eval_file() to accept a structure of this
	type as a parameter.

	* src/egghead.c: In egghead_eval_char(), included 'default' case in main
	'switch' statement to cause an error when new --strict switch is given.

	* src/main.c: Created new default_options() static function for populating
	main eh_opts_t structure with the default configuration. Also added code
	to process new --strict switch. Modified usage() to display information
	about --strict.

	* tests/bad_chars.t: Added another test case to verify that the new
	--strict switch works as intended.

	* tests/help.t: Updated $expected string to reflect new changes that
	display information about the --strict switch.
