Egghead v1.0
============

    Egghead is yet another brainfuck interpreter. It is named so due to the
    fact that it takes a real egghead to even understand the brainfuck
    language.

    Despite the massive plethora of already existent brainfuck interpreters and
    compilers, Egghead came to be since most of them are just amusing scripts.
    Egghead is meant to be a feature-rich brainfuck interpreter that is fully
    GNU-compliant.
