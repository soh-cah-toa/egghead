Installation
============

    Since Egghead is a GNU package, the build system uses GNU Autotools. If
    you've built a GNU package before, you will already be familiar with the
    standard './configure', 'make', 'make install' procedure.

    However, since Egghead is still a relatively new project, portability
    issues haven't been a priority just yet. Therefore, there is no need to
    invoke a 'configure' script. To build and install Egghead, simply run:
    
        $ make
        $ make test
        $ make install

Makefile Targets
================

    The following are valid targets when using 'make':

        all       - Builds 'egghead' executable inside bin/ directory
        test      - Runs test suite
        install   - Installs executable to /usr/local/bin
        uninstall - Removes executable from system
        clean     - Removes local files generated by 'make'
